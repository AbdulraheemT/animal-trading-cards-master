			<p class="box">The emperor penguin is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin species and is endemic to antarctica.
			   The male and female are similar in plumage and size, reaching 122 cm in height and weighing from 22 to 45 kg.
			   As the species has no fixed nest sites that individuals can use to locate their own partner or chick, 
			   emperor penguins must rely on vocal calls alone for identification.
